step for machine learning:
1. Preprocessing -> must know how it works etc
2. Model -> after preprocessing and choosing right model
3. evaluate and tuning -> after model for accuracy model data

usually for linear regression you can use r2_score -> evaluate and tuning
usually for classifier you can use accuracy_score -> evaluate and tuning
usually for cluster you can use silhoute_score -> evaluate and tuning
